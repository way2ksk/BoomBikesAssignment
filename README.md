## General Information
- Create a model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

## Conclusions
- After thorough analysis, we have identified the impact of each variable on bike bookings. Below are the Top 5 predictor variables: 
    1. temp
    2. windspeed
    3. winter
    4. spring
    5. year
